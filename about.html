<p class="center">  The point of this website is to open the eyes of possible adopters and help out families fostering animals to find them a home. We here at MyFosterMyFamily understand how difficult it can be to both find the right home for a pet, and to find the right pet for yourself. It is our goal to help as many foster families as we can to find a home for their pet.</p>
